96800 Sequences
---------------

The ROM address 96800 is where the game stores predefined enemy trajectories,
of which there are 576.
These sequences are made of word-sized instructions. They don't have clearly
defined boundaries or terminators.
The first three words of a sequence set the initial position and angle.

Examples:

The first tank of the game is declared at 92A3C.
This is the rightmost of those three tanks that pop in and out of cover.
Its parameter is 3F. To find the corresponding sequence:
Take the value at 96800+3F*4=968FC, which is CD0.
96800+CD0=974D0, this is where the sequence starts.
